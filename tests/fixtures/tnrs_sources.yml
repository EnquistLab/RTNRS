        The World Checklist of Vascular Plants is based on Kew names and taxonomic
        backbone which has been created by reconciling the names from the International
        Plant Names Index (IPNI) with the taxonomy from the World Checklist of Selected
        Plant Families (WCSP). This Beta version therefore only displays names that
        are in both IPNI and WCVP. It contains both families that have been completed
        and peer reviewed by both external and internal experts on the relevant families
        as well as families that are in the process of being edited and reviewed.
        Some of the original data which WCSP built upon came from our generous collaborators
        listed in the acknowledgements. WCVP aims to represent a global consensus
        view of current plant taxonomy by reflecting the latest published taxonomies
        while incorporating the opinions of taxonomists based around the world.","dataUrl":"http:\/\/sftp.kew.org\/pub\/data-repositories\/WCVP\/wcvp.zip","logo_path":"https:\/\/bien.nceas.ucsb.edu\/bien\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/kew_logo.png","isDefault":"0","version":"12","sourceReleaseDate":"2023-09-28","tnrsDateAccessed":"2024-01-08"},{"sourceID":"3","sourceName":"cact","sourceNameFull":"Cactaceae
