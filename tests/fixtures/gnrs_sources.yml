        resource. It is based on Kew\u2019s names and taxonomic backbone which has
        been created by reconciling the names from the International Plant Names Index
        (IPNI) with the taxonomy from the World Checklist of Selected Plant Families
        (WCSP). This Beta version therefore only displays names that are in both IPNI
        and WCVP. It contains both families that have been completed and peer reviewed
        by both external and internal experts on the relevant families as well as
        families that are in the process of being edited and reviewed. Some of the
        original data which WCSP built upon came from our generous collaborators listed
        in the acknowledgements. WCVP aims to represent a global consensus view of
        current plant taxonomy by reflecting the latest published taxonomies while
        incorporating the opinions of taxonomists based around the world","dataUrl":"http:\/\/sftp.kew.org\/pub\/data-repositories\/WCVP\/","logo_path":"https:\/\/bien.nceas.ucsb.edu\/bien\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/kew_logo.png","version":"v5","sourceReleaseDate":"2021-06-01","tnrsDateAccessed":"2021-07-12"},{"sourceID":"4","sourceName":"usda","sourceNameFull":"USDA
