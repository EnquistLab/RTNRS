## Notes

* devtools::check_rhub() is currently throwing an error which I don't believe is related to this package: "SSL peer certificate or SSH remote key was not OK: [builder.r-hub.io] schannel: SEC_E_UNTRUSTED_ROOT (0x80090325) - The certificate chain was issued by an authority that is not trusted."
